This opportunity was my first big break into the world of software development/engineering, and it served a pivotal purpose in providing me with real-world experience and an opportunity to learn new skills, particularly those that are required in a professional setting. I was tasked with designing and developing a website that served as a <a href='https://vanvrportal.azurewebsites.net/' style="color: white" target="_blank">landing page</a> for medical students interested in VR Anatomy. The website was made entirely with ReactJS and achieved its goal of increasing student engagement and spread awareness of the resources available to students.
