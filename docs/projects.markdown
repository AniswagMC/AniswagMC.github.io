Ah, it seems you're interested in who I am and what I do. 

Well, I'm a software developer who has just recently began to undertake new learning opportunities in the world of programming. I have been working with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React and the likes for a little over 3 years now, and while there is still yet so much for me to learn there, I wanted to try something different. So I've recently decided to carve my own journey and dive into the world of Golang.

With my 'growth mindset' and the Linkedin recruiters out of the way, I want to get into the meat and potatoes of my developer existance --- *personal projects*:

* Airbnb Clone
* Tiktok Claims (Machine Learning)
* Capstone ML Project
