Hi 👋, like I've said, I'm a fresh graduate in the wild, looking for my first gig in the big software world.
If you'd like to know more about my experiences, find out [here](./about.markdown).

While I continue to bring updates to this site, lets a play a little game called two truths and a lie to get to know me a little better: 

❓ I've broken a bone 🦴 by falling off a stationary bicycle 🚲  
❓ I've been in a team of three where I did all the work 😫  
❓ I absolute despise 🤮 milk chocolate 🍫
